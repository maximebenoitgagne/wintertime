Radiative transfer routines
===========================

sun_sfcsolz            computes solar zenith angle at surface given location and time
+- sun_localvec        creates arrays of up, north, and east vectors for fixed locations
+- sun_sunmod          computes solar zenith angle from date, time and location vector
   +- sun_sun2000      computes the Sun vector in geocentric inertial 
   |  +- sun_jd        converts calendar date to Julian day
   |  +- sun_ephparms  computes ephemeris parameters used by other Mission
   |  +- sun_nutate    computes the nutation in longitude and the obliquity
   +- sun_gha2000      computes the Greenwich hour angle in degrees for the
      +- sun_jd        ./.
      +- sun_ephparms  ./.
      +- sun_nutate    ./.

sun_sfcrmud   computes average cosine for direct irradiance
